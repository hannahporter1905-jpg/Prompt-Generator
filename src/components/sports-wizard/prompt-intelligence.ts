 * The "brain" of the Sports Banner Wizard.
 * Contains:
 *  1. ACTION_EXPANSIONS   — turns short chip text into rich physical descriptions
 *  2. BACKGROUND_SUGGESTIONS — recommends background based on sport + action
 *  3. COUNTRY_ATMOSPHERES — enriches "match in X" with specific visual detail
 *  4. buildNarrativePrompt — assembles everything into one cohesive scene description
 *
 * WHY NARRATIVE vs LABELED LIST:
 * A labeled list (Background: ... Lighting: ... Mood: ...) is easy for humans to read
 * but AI image models respond much better to a cohesive scene description because
 * they were trained on image captions, not form data.
 * "A striker caught at the peak of a full-force shot inside a packed Moroccan stadium"
 * generates far more accurate results than:
 * "Soccer athlete — striker. Background: stadium. Country: Morocco. Action: shooting."
