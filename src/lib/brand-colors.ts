/**
 * Brand color palettes — the SINGLE source of truth for brand color enforcement.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * - If a brand has an entry here, GPT is told exactly which colors to use/avoid.
 * - If a brand does NOT have an entry (new brand, or entry not yet added),
 *   the system falls back to: "preserve the color palette from the reference
 *   prompt — do NOT introduce colors that aren't already present."
 *
 * This means new brands work out of the box — they'll keep the colors from
 * their reference prompts. You only need to add an entry here when you want
 * EXTRA strictness (e.g. "NEVER use blue" or "always use gold").
 *
 * TO ADD A NEW BRAND:
 * Just add a new key below with its approved colors and forbidden colors.
 * Both the API and frontend will pick it up automatically.
